# toast-notification

In this project, I showcase a beautifully designed snack bar or toast notification feature for a website, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The implementation includes smooth animations as notifications slide in from the right side, displaying various messages like success, error, and invalid inputs, each complemented by appealing icons. This engaging feature enhances user experience by providing immediate feedback through timely notifications that automatically disappear after a few seconds.
